 *         In the metamodel, a ExecutionEnvironment is a subclass of Node. It is usually part of a general Node, representing the physical hardware environment on which the ExecutionEnvironment resides. In that environment, the ExecutionEnvironment implements a standard set of services that Components require at execution time (at the modeling level these services are usually implicit). For each component Deployment, aspects of these services may be determined by properties in a DeploymentSpecification for a particular kind of ExecutionEnvironment.
